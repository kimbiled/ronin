It needed to resonate with Arab audiences, speak to the values of ethical partnership, and carry the dignity of religious adherence — all while holding its own in the modern fintech space. Our challenge was to translate deep cultural and spiritual foundations into a contemporary design language that builds trust at first glance.",
    description4: "We built the concept around the core value of “shared responsibility.” The idea of two parties walking the same path — transparent, balanced, and aligned — informed the geometric logo system, inspired by traditional Islamic patterns yet simplified for digital use. This duality — tradition and modernity — runs through every visual decision, from structure to spacing.",
    description5:"The new identity centers on a clean, geometric symbol echoing partnership and symmetry. The color palette — earthy sand tones with deep blue accents — evokes professionalism with cultural resonance.

    title: "Dunes — Design That Launches Web3 Ideas",
    description: "From zero to ecosystem: we shaped the entire visual world of the Dunes platform — logo, UI kit, website, and 3D graphics included.",
    description2: "Dunes is a Web3 launchpad designed for projects that don’t settle for average. It gives startups the tools to fund, grow, and scale — without friction. Our job? Build a design system bold enough to match that ambition.",
    description3: "Create the full design identity of a launchpad built to stand out in Web3. We were responsible for everything — from naming suggestions and logomark, to full interface design, 3D branding, and a high-converting website. No references. No shortcuts. Just a blank page and a bold vision.",
    description4: "Digital dunes: a landscape in motion. The brand draws from the paradox of the desert — minimal, yet infinite. We used smooth gradients, golden sands, and sculptural 3D forms to echo movement, value, and transformation. The UI and visuals blend modular structure with cinematic flair — signaling both trust and innovation.",
    description5:"Performance meets presence. We created a modular UI kit and full desktop experience — staking flows, launch forms, dashboards, and project pages — all built for speed, scalability, and Web3 logic. Every screen is designed to feel intuitive, yet high-end. Think product-market fit meets visual alpha.",
    description6: "",
    description7: "",
    description8:"Web3 in your pocket. The mobile version isn’t a shrink-down — it’s a reimagining. Clear flows, fast access, and seamless transitions make it just as powerful as desktop. Whether you're investing, launching, or exploring, Dunes stays fluid and focused.",
